# Simple-HtmlCssJavascript-Form
Simple Html/Css-Javascript form( Class work)
A simple form with an option of reading the JSON file and using the data in JavaScript and declaring the data on the javascript file.
unfortunately, when we run this code in a browser, we might get the following CORS error because our file is not on a server:

To fix this, make sure your JSON file is on a local or remote server. If we use the Live server on our IDE, we won't get this error. But when we load our file directly, we will get this error.
or use the data as declared in the Js file as var Countries = {...};

final output will look like :
